## Business Understanding
### Identifying your business goals

Our project is not aimed to benefit a certain business, but rather a society.

#### Background:

We have a dataset which includes wide-ranging aspects of terrorist attacks of the last 47 years (1970 - 2016). Its size is about 29 MB and it includes attacks' dates, places, motives, number of killed/wounded, social groups it was aimed at, etc.

#### Business goals:

The goal is to provide with information about most dangerous places in certain times of a year and to visualize it.

#### Business success criteria:

Our goals would be met if we manage to provide with some new information, which is not clear from the first sight. To find the most “dangerous” and “safe” places in certain times of a year (or in certain years), predict what places are safe to live in / visit in that time; and to provide quality and clear visualizations for such patterns.

### Assessing your situation

#### Inventory of resources:
 
We have one dataset of 29MB, R studio, and a team of 3 people.
 
#### Requirements, assumptions, and constraints:
 
The project needs to be completed before January 8th, 2018, when poster session will be held.
 
#### Risks and contingencies:
 
The risks are not being able to find appropriate visualization for data, as it is very important for this project.
 
#### Terminology:

Terrorist attack is the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.
 
Target type means a group that is affected by the attack; e.g. civilians or politicians or abortion clinics, etc.
 
#### Costs and benefits:

This will not have any costs or benefits financially speaking, as it is not a project for business.

### Defining your data-mining goals

#### Data-mining goals:
 
Our goals are to find patterns of terrorist attacks depending on time of a year (e.g. season or seasonal holidays), place (e.g. country or city), terrorist groups, targets, etc.; to predict potentially “safe” and “dangerous” places for certain times; provide quality and clear visualization for found patterns.
 
#### Data-mining success criteria:

Our success criteria would be finding patterns that were not visible before and to manage to visualize it in clear and understandable ways.

## Data understanding

## Planning

We have some task which will be common task like data understanding and some other task will be divided in subtask for being completed by each member of the group:

MEMBER 1, 2, 3: Business understanding (think what do we have to acomplish, the resources…) -> 1h/member

MEMBER 1, 2, 3: Data understanding -> 4h/member

MEMBER 1, 2, 3: Data preparation (Analyse data, clean, select …) -> 5h/member

MEMBER 1, 2, 3: Playing with data (create plots, new data tables … as well as to get conclusions later) -> 10h/member

MEMBER 1, 2, 3: Conclusions and reporting results -> 5h/member

This is a first approximation of the project plan. There will probably be some changes like dividing these task in other subtasks, spending more time in some tasks than in others… The total hours of this plan is 25h per member, 75h in total. At first, all the members of the group will be doing all the steps mentioned before. Maybe we will split the work but for now that is the idea.
